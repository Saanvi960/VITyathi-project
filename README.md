This is a simple yet powerful digital calendar application built entirely in Python. Designed for command-line interface (CLI) use, it provides an intuitive way to manage your schedule, events, and tasks directly from your terminal.
 Key Features of my project are:-
Event Scheduling: Easily add, modify, and delete events with specific dates and times.

Task Management: Differentiate between simple calendar events and persistent to-do list tasks.

Daily/Monthly View: Quick visualization of your schedule, either day-by-day or for the whole month.

Event Reminders: Set notifications for upcoming events.

Data Persistence: All events and tasks are saved (e.g., to a JSON or CSV file) so your calendar state is maintained across sessions.
