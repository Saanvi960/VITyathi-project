# Problem Statement:-
Managing personal schedules, important dates, and events manually can be difficult and often leads to missed reminders or poor time organization. To solve this problem, a computerized Calendar project is needed that allows users to view a monthly calendar, add important events, and store them for future reference. This system provides a simple and user-friendly graphical interface where users can easily input the year and month, display a formatted calendar, and add event details for specific dates.
# Scope of the project:-
The scope of this calendar project includes the development of a simple and interactive GUI-based tool that helps users view monthly calendars and manage important dates by adding event details. The project allows users to input any year and month to display the corresponding calendar and store events locally in a file for future use. It supports adding and saving events so they can be retrieved even after the application is closed.
# Target Users:-
The calendar project is designed for users who need a simple and effective tool to manage dates and personal events. It can be useful for students to track assignments, exams, and academic schedules; teachers and professionals to organize meetings and deadlines; and general users to maintain reminders for birthdays, appointments, and daily tasks. Since the interface is easy to understand, it is suitable for users of all age groups with basic computer knowledge.
# High-level features:-
This calendar project includes an interactive GUI that enables users to enter a specific year and month to view the corresponding calendar. It provides an event-adding feature where users can record important dates and reminders. The project stores events permanently in a text file, allowing them to remain available even after the program is closed. The structure of the program is modular, making it easy to enhance in the future with more advanced features like editing events, reminders, and improved visual design.
